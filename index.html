      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate programmer and creative designer with a strong interest in building interactive web, mobile, and desktop applications.
        I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and transforming ideas into user-friendly digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm skilled in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Ionic Framework</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>Express.js</strong>. 
        I’ve built projects ranging from Sudoku games to e-commerce applications, using both frontend and backend technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently graduated with a diploma in <strong>Computer Programming</strong> from <strong>Sheridan College</strong>, and I’m continuously learning new technologies and tools to improve my craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I love UI/UX design, creating digital invitation cards, exploring new software tools, and sharing my knowledge with others.
        My goal is to contribute to innovative tech solutions and eventually work as a full-stack developer.
